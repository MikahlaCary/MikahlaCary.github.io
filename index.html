<p>Since I have never taken a digital media class before, this was all so new to me. Shout out to my Professor James Morgan for teaching so much information that I reluctantly learned. If it were not for the help of my other class mates like Kim, Dat, and Edward I would have never been able to do this.  Thanks for checking out my page and enjoy!</p>
