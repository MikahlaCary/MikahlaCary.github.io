<p>As someone that has never played Minecraft before I was an extra beginner and could not get figure out how to get out a of hole most of the time. Once I got my kids to show me a few things I was able to build. Our instructor made a communal virtual from that he invited the entire class to and we were given the task to build something. I decided to go with a shape I could execute with my limited Minecraft skills, the Goombah from super Mario brothers. The first image is my ruff draft and the second one was made after I knew what I was doing.  </p>
