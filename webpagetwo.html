<p>Artist statement
<br>

	As a San Jose Native, I have seen this city expand and the rent skyrocket over the past ten years. To live in this demanding area, you must have multiple hands in multiple pots. Very reminiscent of an octopus.

	With all the pressure the of being a working mother and full-time student, my surrealistic dreams seep out into my artworks. I create the things I find important, what my life is currently immersed in, or what I find beauty in. I try to incorporate recycled and upcycled materials in my work to reflect this, and to add parts of my subject to my art. 

	If these paintings could talk, they would have amazing stories to tell filled with happiness and heartache. I try to tell these stories within the mood of the artwork. Knowing that the Bay Area is so demanding, I am just an artist out here in San Jose trying to reach my tentacles in multiple directions. I am the octopus trying to catch a dream.
